## How to use the extension

**Desktop**: Move the subfolder **arf-multilanguage**  from the **_demo** folder to your Qlik Sense extensions folder.

**QMC**: Upload the **arf-multilanguage.zip** from the list folder to the QMC

**Demo**: Use the ***arf-multilanguage-demo.qvf** Qlik Sense application for an extension demo.
